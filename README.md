# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Visualization-Projects
Machine Learning:

Involves training computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
This allows them to identify patterns, make predictions, and solve problems.

Data Visualization:

Focuses on creating visual representations of data to make it easier to understand.
This can include charts, graphs, maps, and other visual elements.

Machine Learning and Data Visualization Projects:
Combine these techniques to gain insights from data and then present those insights in a clear and compelling way.

This can involve tasks like:
Visualizing the performance of machine learning models.
Exploring features and identifying relationships within data used for machine learning.
Communicating machine learning results to both technical and non-technical audiences.
These projects can be found at various difficulty levels, from beginner-friendly explorations of data distributions to complex visualizations of model performance.
